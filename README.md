# CSE-310-Compiler-Sessional

Welcome to the Compiler Sessional course repository for CSE-310. This repository contains course materials, code examples, assignments related to this course.


The purpose of this course is to construct a simple compiler. To do so, this contains four offlines for different for steps.

## Offlines

1. **1st offline:**
- Implement a Symbol Table

2. **2nd offline:**
- Implement a lexical analyzer, also known as a tokenizer

3. **3rd offline:**
-  construct the last part of the front end of a compiler for a subset of C language. That means we will perform syntax analysis and semantic  analysis with a grammar rule containing function implementation in this assignment

4. **4th offline:**
- Generate intermediate code for a source program
